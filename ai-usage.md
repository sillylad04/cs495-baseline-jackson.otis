I kind of used AI to assist earning me those sweet, sweet 10 extra points.

I learned the hard way that Github has a great, big button that will explain a problem to you when a job fails. It opens an AI chat and automatically sends the message: "Please find a solution for this failing job. Use the logs, job definition, and any referenced files where the failure occurred. Keep your response focused on the solution and include code suggestions when appropriate."

This was beyond helpful for learning to use Github for this assignment. Note that I did this for each and every commit that failed the unittests for one reason or another. It pointed out indentation errors, import errors, and the like. Count on me using this Github feature during the school year.
