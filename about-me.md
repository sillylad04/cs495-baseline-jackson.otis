• I've used Python and a little bit of Java, R, and Lua. I feel most confident in Python.

• I've coded mostly in classes. The only coding I've done at internships is Excel equations, and some LeetCode whenever I got too bored.
    Personal projects I've done are:
    
      - Python: Spending tracker script that takes a .csv file of all transactions on my bank account and adds up all expenses. Very useful for making my summer & fall budgets. I'm able to export specific date ranges from my bank's website as to get an accurate understanding on how quickly I spend money. I made an identical script that sums up my income, too!
      - Python: Web image scraper that only kind of worked. I wanted to download all images off of a website by inserting the URL of the website. It was able to download some images, but not all. I'm hoping that my time in Web and Mobile Development will allow me to understand better what went wrong with it.
      - Lua: Modding the video game Balatro. I'll avoid explaining game mechanics, but I made 2 jokers that function! 'Slot Machine' has a small chance to turn scoring cards in a 3 OAK into 7s, and 'Stamps' gains +2 mult when the effect of any seal is triggered. I was able to sort of bypass learning Lua and just reuse code from other jokers, making small tweaks.
    In classes, I've made:
      - CS316: (Java) UDP Client for NIST Servers, TCP File Service, Pi Value Estimator, and a Call center simulation
      - CS222: (Python) Course scheduling courses, which admittedly I could have contributed more to.
      - CS224: (Python) Binary search tree
• While in terms of scale the Binary search tree was the largest file I've worked on, The TCP File Service is what I feel was the largest system I've worked on. It was a group project that me and one other CS student did.

• I feel comfortable with topics I've learned in previous classes, though I suppose I'd need a little refresher. I feel that client-server communication was fun and easy to implement, though on a small scale. Troubleshooting is also something I am comfortable with, though I do despise it greatly sometimes.

• If I'm being honest, I feel least comfortable with using version control systems like Git effectively. I've had to use it for one class, CS222, and that's it. My team didn't use it very effectively, so my only usage of it has left a sour taste in my mouth over it. I am also uncomfortable with learning new languages, but who isn't?

• My concentration is in Data Analytics and Machine Learning
